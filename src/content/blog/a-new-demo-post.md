Painting does not have to be difficult. I thought today, this would be our crazy painting. A lot of things happening right here. Painting used to drive me crazy. Whatever works is good. This is the lazy man's way of painting. Just make little criss-cross strokes. Keep it moving. Just let it work around and play. You can do anything that you want to do... you can move mountains!

Now we're ready to put some highlights on these little leaves out here. Where are we going with this? Another thing that seems to give us a lot of problems is almighty clouds. As long as you have fun and learn from it, nothing is wasted. We are really trying to teach you a technique. We're not trying to teach you to copy. The more that you practice, the more you're able to visualize things. Let's just have a good time. Let's just enjoy today. This is where the whole ecosystem starts. You don't always have to have a perfect vision in your mind.
